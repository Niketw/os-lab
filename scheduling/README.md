# Explanation:
- The first line 5 indicates the number of processes.
- The second line 2 indicates the time slice for Round Robin scheduling.
- The following lines list each process's arrival time and burst time:

Process 1: Arrival time = 0, Burst time = 5
Process 2: Arrival time = 1, Burst time = 3
Process 3: Arrival time = 2, Burst time = 8
Process 4: Arrival time = 3, Burst time = 6
Process 5: Arrival time = 4, Burst time = 4
